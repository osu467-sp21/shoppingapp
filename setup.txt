1. Setup MySQL Server
	- https://medium.com/macoclock/mysql-on-mac-getting-started-cecb65b78e
		- Make sure to note these fields in setup as you will need to add these to your application.properties:
		Ex:
			- spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mysql
			- spring.datasource.username=username
			- spring.datasource.password=password
		- To connect to AWS RDS will need to change these fields and check the Security Gropu for inbound rules

2. Connect using MySQL Workbench
	- instructions for this also in the ref link above
	- from here, can 'Test Connection' for both dev and prod

3. Open the project in your IDE (this example uses IntelliJ)

4. If configured, dependencies in the pom.xml will install
	- if not, then navigate to the side panel with 'Maven', then 'Lifecycle', and then execute the install

5. To run, open the terminal and enter:
	- ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run

6. Test using Postman

7. Make sure when you commit, no application.properties or temp files like .iml files
